# Market Sentiments and Trading Trends
A Google Colab project exploring how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed Index) influences trader performance on Hyperliquid trade data.
We analyze trading behavior under emotional states (Fear & Greed) and build predictive insights to support smarter trading strategies.

# Project Overview
* Datasets
    1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment → Fear/Greed Index (value + classification).
    2. Hyperliquid Historical Trades → Execution data, PnL, leverage, etc.

* Objective
    1.Link sentiment with trader performance.
    2.Find when traders profit most (Fear vs Greed).
    3.Build predictive models with time-based splits.


# Key Insights
* ~90% of trades occur during Fear or Greed phases.
* Extreme Greed → high risk, high reward (few big winners, many losers).
* Fear → contrarians profit, but high volatility.
* Neutral & Extreme Fear → low opportunity zones.
* Sentiment lags PnL → useful for confirmation, not trade triggers.

# Tools & Stack
* Google Colab 
* Python, Pandas, NumPy for processing
* Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
* Scikit-learn for ML pipelines (Logistic Regression, Random Forests)

# Visuals & KPIs
    
* Trade volume by sentiment
* Average PnL under Fear vs Greed
* Rolling 7-day PnL vs Sentiment correlation
* Feature importance ranking (predictive model)

# Conclusion
   * Emotional sentiment drives most trading activity.
   * Best opportunities lie in Greed (momentum) and Fear (contrarian) states.
   * Strategies must combine PnL metrics + sentiment for better risk-adjusted returns.
